Investigating PKC Alpha in Uterine Smooth Muscle Contractility

This study explores the role of PKC alpha, a protein kinase C isoform, in calcium-dependent signaling pathways that regulate uterine smooth muscle contractions during labor. Using human myometrial cells obtained from cesarean sections, we aim to:
	1.	Identify PKC alpha as the dominant isoform involved in contractile signaling.
	2.	Examine the interaction between the ETA receptor, Gαi proteins, and PKC alpha using molecular techniques like FRET.
	3.	Correlate PKC alpha activation with intracellular calcium dynamics and contractile function.

The findings could lead to targeted therapies for labor complications, benefiting women, newborns, and healthcare systems.


Sample Practical Reports

1. Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) Modeling in Neuroblastoma Cells

This study investigates IRE1 pathway activation in the UPR using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with ER stressors (Brefeldin A, Tunicamycin, Thapsigargin).
	•	Objective: Assess UPR activation via XBP-1 mRNA splicing.
	•	Methods: qPCR and electrophoresis to measure relative intensity of UPR activation.
	•	Findings:
	•	Brefeldin A and Tunicamycin caused the highest UPR activation.
	•	Thapsigargin produced moderate activation, highlighting stressor-specific responses.
	•	Significance: Improves understanding of cellular stress mechanisms with relevance to diseases like cancer and neurodegeneration.

2. Purine Signaling in Glial Cells

This research explores the role of purine receptors (P2Y and P2X) in glial calcium dynamics.
	•	Objective: Characterize purine signaling pathways in glial cells.
	•	Methods: Fluo-4 calcium imaging and pharmacological manipulation of purine receptors.
	•	Findings:
	•	P2Y receptor antagonists significantly reduced calcium signaling.
	•	ATP analogues indicated diverse receptor subtype activation.
	•	Significance: Enhances understanding of purine signaling in CNS disorders with therapeutic implications.


 Leigh Syndrome Referral Report

Overview

This report analyzes the case of a 6-month-old female with Leigh Syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disease caused by a mutation in the MT-ATP6 gene (m.8993T>G).

Key Details

	•	Symptoms: Developmental delays, hypotonia, and basal ganglia lesions identified on MRI.
	•	Genetics: Mutation impacts ATP production by disrupting mitochondrial function.
	•	Management:
	•	Ketogenic diet to shift metabolism toward beta-oxidation.
	•	Nicotinamide riboside to enhance mitochondrial biogenesis.
	•	Sodium citrate to manage lactic acid build-up.
	•	Significance: Highlights challenges in diagnosing and managing rare mitochondrial diseases and the need for targeted therapies.

Recommendations

Future research should focus on:
	•	Using patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models for drug testing.
	•	Developing CRISPR-based genetic therapies to correct mitochondrial mutations.
